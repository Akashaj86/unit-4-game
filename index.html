    <h1><strong> Crystals Counter Game </strong></h1>
    <h2>Welcome to The Fortess of Solitude!</h2>
    <p>You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
        There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You win the game by matching your total score to the random number provided. You lose the game if your total score surpasses the random number given. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Once the game is reset, the crystals will change their value.
    </p>
